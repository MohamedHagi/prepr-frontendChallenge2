# Full-Stack React Application - PreprLabs Clone

## Overview

Welcome to the PreprLabs Clone Full-Stack application! This project is structured with two main components: the **client** (React) and the **server** (Node.js/MongoDB). The primary goal is to recreate the [PreprLabs](https://preprlabs.org/) registration and login pages, focusing on a seamless user experience for sign-up and login processes.

## Objective

The main objective is to replicate the registration and login pages of PreprLabs, creating a seamless user experience for signing up and logging in. The application emphasizes user-friendly design and efficient conversion processes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The client-side application is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring optimal user experience on different devices.

- **Sign-up Form**: The sign-up form is implemented with working mouseover effects. Users can register through the form or use the Single Sign-on (SSO) button.

- **Single Sign-on (SSO)**: Users can log in using the SSO button, experiencing a smooth and streamlined login process.

- **Interactive Elements**: Key click events, including the register button, login button, and SSO button, are implemented for a responsive and interactive interface.

- **Node.js and MongoDB Backend**: The server-side application is built using Node.js and MongoDB to handle authentication and user data storage.

## Technologies Used

### Client (React)

- **React**: The client application is built using the React library, providing a modular and efficient component-based structure.

- **CSS**: Styling is achieved using CSS, delivering a clean and visually appealing layout.

### Server (Node.js/MongoDB)

- **Node.js**: The server is built using Node.js, providing a runtime environment for the backend.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user data.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohamedHagi/prepr-frontendChallenge1.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the client directory.

    ```bash
    cd prepr-frontendChallenge1/client
    ```

3. Install client dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Navigate to the server directory.

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    ```

5. Install server dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6. Run the client application.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The client application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ by default.

7. Run the server application.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will run on a separate port, and the client application will interact with it for authentication and data storage.

## Usage

Explore the recreated registration and login pages by interacting with the sign-up form, including the mouseover effects. Use the register button, login button, and SSO button to test their respective functionalities.
